# mcp-setup

Repository for MCP setup utilities and configuration.

## Contents
- Workspace configuration and helper scripts

## How to use
1. Clone or initialize locally
2. See `.vscode/mcp.json` for workspace settings

## What you did - Changes to the rules file

- Removed mandatory, machine-only trigger requirements and enforcement language.
- Replaced enforcement-oriented text with contributor-focused guidance and opt-in tooling recommendations.
- Suggested moving logging/trigger automation into an optional GitHub Actions workflow under `.github/workflows/` rather than requiring runtime hooks in docs.
- Added a privacy note advising not to log secrets or user content and to document any opt-in telemetry clearly.

I have trouble authenticating with mcp server. I have the updated version of vs code, tried restarting and also changing network.
